## Brownian Motion Simulation in Python

This repository implements a simulation of a Brownian robot moving within a square arena. The robot undergoes random rotations and straight movements, mimicking the characteristics of Brownian motion.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x installed on your system.
* `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries installed in your Python environment.

### Setting Up the Environment

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/Surajpatra700/Brownian_motion.git](https://github.com/Surajpatra700/Brownian_motion.git)

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

Using a virtual environment helps isolate project dependencies from your system-wide Python installation. Tools like venv or conda come in handy. Refer to their documentation for specific instructions.

3. **Install Dependencies:**

Activate your virtual environment (if created). Then, install the required libraries using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib

4. **Running the Simulation**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:

Bash
cd Brownian_motion
Use code with caution.
Run the simulation script:

Bash
python simulate_brownian_motion.py
Use code with caution.
This will generate a video file named "brownian_motion.mp4" visualizing the robot's trajectory within the arena.
